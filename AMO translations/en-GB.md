**Yet Another Dark-Light Toggle**

Switch between dark, light, or system colour schemes with a single click.  
The icon reflects the current mode, and a popup briefly confirms the selected setting on click.

**For Firefox version > 95**

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note**  
This add-on only affects websites that support both dark and light themes using standard web technology.  
If a website doesn‚Äôt support dark mode, this extension cannot make it dark.

Website designers may choose to implement both light and dark themes. If they don‚Äôt, this extension can‚Äôt compensate.  
There‚Äôs no reliable way to detect that in advance. If toggling has no effect, it simply means the site doesn‚Äôt support it.  
**Please direct your frustration accordingly.**

**Minimal add-on**  
This is the simplest possible add-on with the least possible permissions.

Clicking the add-on icon in your toolbar cycles the colour scheme preference for browser content between:

- dark colours
- light colours
- system colours (dark or light)

You can enable or disable values in the cycle from the add-on content settings.

A small popup briefly confirms the selected mode. It appears briefly after clicking and closes after 1 second.

**Website support**  
This add-on relies on the fact that websites have their own proper stylesheets for dark and light modes, for example DuckDuckGo.  
An increasing number of websites now offer light and dark schemes, though you may need to select a specific option to inherit your browser‚Äôs colours, e.g. Google, GitHub, StackOverflow, and many more.
