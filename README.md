# Yet Another Dark-Light Toggle ! [![Mozilla Add-on](https://img.shields.io/amo/v/yadl-toggle)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/yadl-toggle/)

**For Firefox version > 95.**

> **⚠️ Important Note**  
> This add-on only affects websites that support both dark and light themes using standard web technology.  
> If a website doesn’t support dark mode, this extension cannot make it dark.
>
> Website designers may choose to implement both light and dark themes. If they don’t, this extension can’t compensate.  
> There’s no reliable way to detect that in advance. If toggling has no effect, it simply means the site doesn’t support it.  
> **Please direct your frustration accordingly.**

## Minimal add-on

This is the simplest possible add-on with the least possible permissions.

Clicking the add-on icon in your toolbar cycles the color scheme preference _for browser content_, between the following values:

1. dark colors
2. light colors
3. inherit system colors (dark or light)

You can enable or disable values in the cycle from the add-on content settings.

A small popup briefly confirms the selected mode. It appears briefly after clicking and closes after 1 second.

## Website support

This add-on relies on the fact that websites have their own proper stylesheets for dark and light modes, for example [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/).  
An increasing number of websites now offer light and dark schemes, though you may need to select a specific option to inherit your browser’s colors, e.g. Google, GitHub, StackOverflow, and many more.
